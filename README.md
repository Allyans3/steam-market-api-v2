Installation
------------

### With composer

Run this text in console to install this package:

```
composer require allyans3/steam-market-api-v2
```

This package currently offers 7 API calls you can make to Steam, 1 API to CSGOFloat-API and 2 technical methods.

Note
----

All methods don't have delays. If you are using some method in cycle, please use this in-built php function to prevent steam block for a few minutes:
```
sleep(rand(10,16));
```
Recommended 10 and more seconds.

Creating new object
-------------------

```
$api = new SteamApi();
```

Usage
-----

### Market Listings

```
$options = [
    'start'       => 0,
    'count'       => 100,
    'sort_column' => 'price',
    'sort_dir'    => 'asc'
];

$response = $api->getMarketListings(730, $options);
```

This will return a list of 100 items, you'll need to change the `start` option to cycle through the complete list of item.

You'll get 3 technical fields and array of items:

```
[
    "start"       => 0
    "pagesize"    => 100
    "total_count" => 14941
    "items" => [
        0 => [
            "name"          => "AK-47 | The Empress (Field-Tested)"
            "image"         => "https://steamcommunity-a.akamaihd.net/economy/image/-9a81dlWLwJ2UUGcVs_nsVtzdOEdtWwKGZZLQHTxDZ7I56KU0Zwwo4NUX4oFJZEHLbXH5ApeO4YmlhxYQknCRvCo04DEVlxkKgpot7HxfDhnwMzJemkV09m7hJKOhOTLPr7Vn35cppMh2L2VrN-h2geyqhc-MD3xJYecIANrMwvZ8wK8wr3nhJC6vJ2dy3B9-n51Yx1fd-M"

```
$options = [
    'market_hash_name' => "AK-47 | The Empress (Field-Tested)",
];

$response = $api->getSaleHistory(730, $options);
```

This will return the lifetime sales history for an item by date.


```
[ 
    "sale_date"  => "2017-09-15"
    "sale_price" => 150.858
    "quantity"   => 35
]
```

    'currency'         => 1
];

$response = $api->getItemPricing(730, $options);
```

This will return the lowest and median price for an item.

```
[ 
    "success"          => true
    "volume"           => "121"
    "lowest_price"     => 36.66
    "lowest_price_str" => "$36.66"
    "median_price"     => 34.56
    "median_price_str" => "$34.56"
]
```

    'start' => 0,
    'count' => 100,
    'query' => 'AK-47 | The Empress',
    'exact' => true
];

$response = $api->searchItems(730, $options);
